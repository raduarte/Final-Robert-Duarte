        <p class="courseDescription">CS 120 is the final installment of the CS
            021 and 110 tree. It switches over to C++, and teaches advanced topics
            within object oriented programming, such as polymorphism and memory usage.

        <p class="finalDesc">The final for this course was an open ended project
            in which we had to create a game. I worked in a group with two other
            students and together we created a sidescroller. The game consists of
            a square on a plane, moving forever until it hits a spike. We included
            a score keeper, as well as accounts to save scores and keep a running
            high score page. This project is my personal favorite, as I think it
            came out very well and it was a lot of fun to make.
